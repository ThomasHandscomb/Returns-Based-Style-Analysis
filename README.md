# Returns-Based-Style-Analysis

A simple, self contained example of how to implement RBSA in R. This steps through the process of creating optimisation matrices from return streams and using the QP solver in the quadprog package to 
find an optimal solution.

A plot and comparison to a simple random search illustrate the optimality of the solution.
